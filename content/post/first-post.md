# Nearenough
**Nearenough** is a Java client of the [Roughtime](https://roughtime.googlesource.com/roughtime) 
secure time synchronization protocol.

Nearenough aims to be 100% interoperable with the wider Roughtime ecosystem.

## About the Roughtime Protocol
[Roughtime](https://roughtime.googlesource.com/roughtime) is a protocol that aims to achieve rough 
time synchronisation in a secure way that doesn't depend on any particular time server, and in such
a way that, if a time server does misbehave, clients end up with cryptographic proof of it. It was 
created by Adam Langley and Robert Obryk.

## Building
Nearenough bundles all required dependencies in the `lib` directory. Add those `.jar` files to
your IDE's project classpath. Building is IDE-only for the moment. 

## Quickstart

### Client Examples
See [`examples/NioClient.java`](../master/examples/NioClient.java) and 
[`examples/NettyClient.java`](../master/examples/NettyClient.java) for examples of how to send a 
request to a Roughtime server and process the response.

### DIY Client
If implementing your own client, the general idea is:

```java
// The RoughTime server's long term public key, must be obtained a priori
byte[] serverLongTermPublicKey = { ... };

// Create client passing the server's long-term key
RoughtimeClient client = new RoughtimeClient(serverLongTermPublicKey);

// Construct a request, then encode it for transmission
RtMessage request = client.createRequest();
ByteBuf encodedRequest = RtWire.toWire(request);

// send encodedRequest using NIO, Netty, or some other mechanism...
RtMessage response = // ...and receive the response via NIO, Netty, etc ...

// Process the response
client.processResponse(response);

// Check the result
if (client.isResponseValid()) {
  Instant midpoint = Instant.ofEpochMilli(client.midpoint() / 1000L);
  System.out.println("midpoint: " + midpoint);
} else {
  System.out.println("Invalid response: " + client.invalidResponseCause().getMessage());
} 
```
See the javadocs in [`RoughtimeClient.java`](../master/src/nearenough/client/RoughtimeClient.java) 
for more information.

## Implementation Status
Nearenough is stable. 

* Protocol - Client protocol is feature complete. 
* Client - Feature complete except for ecosystem-style request chaining.
