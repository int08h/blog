If you have not read Maciej Ceglowski's clearheaded and perspicacious talk on [Website Obesity](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm#conclusion)
take a moment and do so. It's entertaining, insightful, and a tad wicked. 

The talk concludes with a profound question about the future of the Web. Maciej identifies two 
competing visions:

## Web As Minecraft

> The first vision is the **Web as Minecraft**--an open world with simple pieces that obey simple rules. 
> The graphics are kind of clunky, but thatâ€™s not the point, and nobody cares.
>
> In this vision, you are meant to be an active participant, you're supposed to create stuff, 
> and you'll have the most fun when you collaborate with others.

He points out that Minecraft players have created 
[mind-blowing creations](https://www.google.com/webhp?q=most+amazing+things+built+in+minecraft)
using these simple and robust rules in an open-world. Including 
full-blown [computers](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Redstone_computers) that
themselves could run Minecraft.

## Web As Call-of-Duty

> The other vision is of the **web as Call of Duty**--an exquisitely produced, 
> kind-of-but-not-really-participatory guided experience with breathtaking effects and lots of 
> opportunities to make in-game purchases.
>
> Creating this kind of Web requires a large team of specialists. No one person can understand 
> the whole pipeline, nor is anyone expected to. Even if someone could master all the technologies 
> in play, the production costs would be prohibitive.
>
> The user experience in this kind of Web is that of being carried along, with the illusion of agency, 
> within fairly strict limits. There's an obvious path you're supposed to follow, and disincentives 
> to keep you straying from it. As a bonus, the game encodes a whole problematic political agenda. 
> The only way to reject it is not to play.
>
> Despite the lavish production values, there's a strange sameness to everything. You're always in the same brown war zone.

Do you every feel that way? Do you find many large web properties have a creepy similarity?

## Conclusion

Maciej turns to why this really matters:

> Pretending that one needs a team of professionals to put simple articles online will 
> become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Overcomplicating the web means lifting up the ladder
> that used to make it possible for people to teach themselves and surprise everyone with unexpected new ideas.

And there it is: an ugly future web sterilized of things "normal" people could have created
if not for the mandatory "web stack" toolchain (as complex as an AAA game) that's a prerequisite
just to post a picture of a cat.

Maciej finishes with: "**Keeping the Web simple keeps it awesome**".

I couldn't agree more.
